# GAMES HUB 

This is a project to play with Chakra and the RAWG API.

Main dependencies:
Vite, React, TS, Axios, Chakra, Motion

## Future improvements

Not sure when and if and when I will get back to it, but here is a laundry list of what should be next:

- Better state management, useContext will help in some cases, maybe a Reducer. 
- Work a bit more on accessibility 
- Not sure if I want it to be a SPA and have some fancy pop up game info cards, or maybe move into Next.js and have some full game pages
